Perfect! Now I understand - you already have a complete Electron app with React/Vite setup. I've created the integration code to add VSCode extension communication to your existing DevStackUI app.
What to do:
1. Update your existing files:

Replace your main.js with the updated version (adds VSCode server)
Replace your preload.js with the updated version (adds VSCode APIs)

2. Add React components:

Create src/hooks/useVSCodeBridge.js - React hook for VSCode communication
Create src/components/VSCodeBridge.jsx - UI component for testing communication
Add the component to your main React app

3. For your VSCode extension:

Add the DevStackUIBridge class to your existing extension
Add these commands to your extension's package.json:

json{
  "contributes": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "command": "devstackui.connect",
        "title": "Connect to DevStackUI"
      },
      {
        "command": "devstackui.disconnect", 
        "title": "Disconnect from DevStackUI"
      },
      {
        "command": "devstackui.sendTest",
        "title": "Send Test to DevStackUI"
      },
      {
        "command": "devstackui.getWorkspaceInfo",
        "title": "Get Workspace Info"
      }
    ]
  }
}
4. How it works:

Your existing React app now has VSCode communication built in
Port 8765 handles the communication
The React component gives you a UI to test sending/receiving messages
Your VSCode extension can send commands, requests, and data to your Electron app
Everything integrates with your existing Vite/React setup

5. Testing:

Run your app: npm run dev
Open your VSCode extension
Use the command palette: "Connect to DevStackUI"
Send test messages between them
Use the React component UI to monitor communication

The bridge is designed to work seamlessly with your existing DevStackUI setup - no need to change your current architecture!
